== LIBRESPACK ==

Librespack is a small C/C++ library, in the public domain, that allows the user to pack multiple files into one file and later decode data from a respack file. 
Documentation and usage instructions are provided in respack.h and an example can be found from example.c

Librespack does not depend on anything beyond the C compiler, and has been tested with:
 - gcc and g++
 - clang and clang++
 - tcc

(C++ compilers are sometimes stricter than C compilers, so testing the code with them is not a bad idea)
